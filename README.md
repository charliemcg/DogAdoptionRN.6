# DogAdoptionRN.6
Rebuild of DogAdoption for React Native 0.6. See DogAdoption for build history.

Added a Django backend.

There are two Dummy users for testing purposes. Dummy1 and Dummy2. Every dog has one of these dummies as the dogâ€™s relevant user. New users can sign up. Existing users can sign in (including the dummies). Non existing users cannot sign in. Currently signed in user is stored in redux. Users can message each other.
